GPIO IO Toggle example

Example Description

GPIO ports are connected on APB2 bus, using BSRRH and BSRRL registers 2 cycles
are required to set a pin and another cycle to reset it. So GPIO pins can toggle
at AHB clock divided by 4.

This example describes how to use BSRR and BRR (Port Bit Set/Reset Register
and Port Bit Reset Register) for maximum IO toggling.

PD0 and PD2 (configured in output pushpull mode) toggles in a forever loop:
 - Set PD0 and PD2 by setting corresponding bits in BSRR register
 - Reset PD0 and PD2 by setting corresponding bits in BRR register

In this example, HCLK is configured at 72 MHz so PD0 and PD2 toggles at 18MHz.
To achieve the maximum IO toggling frequency, you have to configure your compiler
options for high speed optimization.

GPIO JTAG Remap example

Example Description

This example provides a short description of how to use the JTAG IOs as standard
GPIOs and gives a configuration sequence.

First, the SWJ-DP is disabled. The SWJ-DP pins are configured as output push-pull.
Five LEDs connected to the PA.13(JTMS/SWDAT), PA.14(JTCK/SWCLK), PA.15(JTDI),
PB.03(JTDO) and PB.04(JTRST) pins are toggled in an infinite loop.

Note that once the JTAG IOs are disabled, the connection with the host debugger is
lost and cannot be re-established as long as the JTAG IOs remain disabled.

To avoid this situation, a specified pin is connected to a push-button that is used
to disable or not the JTAG IOs:
 1. push-button pressed at reset: JTAG IOs disabled	and LED1 turned on
 2. push-button not pressed at reset: JTAG IOs unchanged and LED2 turned on

Before starting this example, you should disconnect your tool chain debugging probe
and run the example in standalone mode.
